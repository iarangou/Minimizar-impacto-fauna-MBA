# Amphibian-Crossing Simulation (NetLogo)

This NetLogo project simulates the movement of toads and moorhens through a fragmented landscape intersected by a road. The model explores how species form emergent paths, respond to seasonal food sources, and interact with mitigation features like green crossings.

## 💡 Overview

Inspired by the agent-based model presented by Crevier et al. (2021) on black bears.

Based on the Paths framework (NetLogo), extended with species-specific rules.

Designed for exploratory studies on how infrastructure affects wildlife movement.

## 🐸 Key Features

Two animal agents: toads and moorhens, with different repulsion and need-for-food levels.

Emergent routes generated by repeated agent movement.

Green crossings (lime patches) allow safe passage through roads.

Seasonal food zones simulate varying resource availability.

Mortality risk when crossing roads without a green passage.

## ✅ Future Work

Add reproduction behavior.

Determine real-time equivalences for ticks (e.g., 1 tick = 1 hour).

Simulate population dynamics and broader ecological impacts.
